Our project is a real-world asset tokenization platform designed to promote cryptocurrency usage globally. Users can commoditize their real-world buildings and assets, making profits on the blockchain. Deployed on the Stacks Blockchain and built using NextJS for the frontend, our platform combines the power of real-world assets (RWA) with our very own trading platform, Infinity Stacks.
